# webpack-bundle
This is my first webpack bundle.


This is simple bundle that includes:

"scripts": {
  "build": "webpack",
  "watch": "webpack --watch",
  "start": "webpack serve --open"
},

"browser-sync-webpack-plugin"
"css-loader"
"html-webpack-plugin"
"sass"
"sass-loader"
"style-loader"
"webpack":
"webpack-cli"
"webpack-dev-server"

Probably, in future I'll improve this bundle.
